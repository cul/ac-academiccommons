<h2 id="faq">FAQ</h2>

<p>For questions related to who may upload works to Academic Commons, what works are eligible for inclusion, and details about the upload process, please see our <%= link_to t('blacklight.header_links.faq'), faq_path %>.</p>

<h2 id="collection-policy">Collection Policy</h2>

<p>Academic Commons accepts uploads of research and scholarship from Columbia University community members. In addition, repository staff members actively solicit content from Columbia schools, departments, and affiliates, and are the first point of contact for information about adding new collections to the repository (via <a href="mailto:ac@columbia.edu">ac@columbia.edu</a>). Decisions about which works are included in Academic Commons are determined by the originating school, department, or affiliate.</p>

<p>Works may be deaccessioned from Academic Commons based on consultation with the originating school, department, or affiliate.</p>
