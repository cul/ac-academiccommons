// Vite does not include typechecking during its transpilation step (converting TypeScript to JavaScript).
// We will just use TypeScript for static type checking in the IDE during development.
// Therefore, we include the 'noEmit' option to prevent the tsc compiler from generating any output files when we run it locally.
// We also enable 'isolatedModules' to ensure compatibility with Vite's module handling; Vite processes each file as an isolated module,
// and this option catches certain errors that could arise from not adhering to the isolated module structure.
// Additionally, Vite will ignore any set "target" in tsconfig.json, because it uses esbuild for transpilation, which has its own target settings.
